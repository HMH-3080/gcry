# It is the documented RSS opt-in for multi-mutator programs (docs/POLICY.md),
# where empty chunks are otherwise kept mapped. It releases empties *within*
# `empty_chunk_retain`, and from 2026-08-03 the Linux process default for that
# budget was 0, so the opt-in did nothing for two months and nothing noticed:
# Kemal EC4 post-GC RSS 83.4 MB with it against 83.7 without
# (`bench/log/linux/2026-09-26-parallel-dormant-inert/`). This is the gate that
# would have.

# Multi-mutator by construction (two plain threads parked on a pipe, past the

# collections. Reports the empty chunks kept, the ones made dormant, and RSS.
#
#   --expect-dormant   the opt-in must have made empties dormant

#                      than `GC.collect`, which since 2026-09-28 makes the
#                      empties dormant by default (`GCRY_PARALLEL_RELEASE_ON_COLLECT`);
#                      the opt-in arms need it to show the opt-in's own effect

# built it in a frame of main's and overwrote that stack region afterwards,
# which held until 2026-09-28, when a change to the marker's code (no change
# to what it marks) left macOS retaining the whole burst on every run: 60 MB
# after the collect, 4 MB of empty chunks. One conservative word naming the
# outer array keeps all of it, and main's frames and registers are where
# such a word lives. The burst thread's are gone once it is joined.
# A plain thread has no execution context, so no IO: the peak is read on main
# after the join, with the burst still resident because nothing has
# collected it.
# Where the burst lived, XOR'd so the record is not itself a root. On a
# retained burst the holders search looks for words naming either the outer
# array or its buffer: CI failed this gate once on Linux (run 36625152299,
# "seeded by … parked 5805 KiB", 1 in ~60 runs, never locally in 30), and a
# seed total says which root kind held it but not which stack or where.
